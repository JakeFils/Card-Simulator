# Card-Simulator
This GitHub project is a dynamic web application that allows users to explore different travel destinations. It features a responsive and visually appealing interface with a collection of panels, each representing a unique location. The panels are displayed in a container and contain background images, headings, and interactive functionality.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The CSS styling provides visual enhancements such as responsive layouts, transitions, and customized typography using the "Muli" font from Google Fonts. The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the panels, allowing users to click on a panel to activate it and expand its size. When a panel is clicked, the active class is applied to it, triggering the transition effect and revealing the heading associated with that panel.

The project leverages event listeners and DOM manipulation to ensure only one panel is active at a time. Clicking on a panel removes the active class from all other panels, and the clicked panel becomes the active one.

Additionally, the project includes a media query that adjusts the layout for smaller screens, ensuring a responsive design. On screens with a maximum width of 480px, the container expands to 100% of the viewport width, and the fourth and fifth panels are hidden.

This project can serve as a template for showcasing various travel destinations or any other content that can be represented in panels. It provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for users to explore and interact with different elements.
